  M8M writer. Split a Codex or Claude skill into milestones, FlowSteps,
  and tools, then write one toolbox table and one flowchart. Each
  milestone is a harness checkpoint with a required asset. Use when
  the user wants to identify checkpoints, list tools per checkpoint, or
  scaffold a flow. Invoke as $m8m-harness-builder.

# M8M harness builder

This skill **writes** a split. **Milestones are the harness.**
FlowSteps are a guide, like a normal skill.

```text
identify milestones
  → list FlowSteps inside each (atomic; prefer ONE tool)
  → develop that tool (existing / promote / generate-new stub)
  → write one FlowStep table + one milestone flowchart
     (if/for attach to the asset check, not to tools)
  → scaffold flow YAML and tool stubs
```

Three words:

```text
Milestone  = compulsory harness. previous.out is this.in.
             Required asset (file, image, json proof, data) or BLOCK.
FlowStep   = atomic goal inside that checkpoint.
             Prefers one tool. Tool is optional.
             Table order is the guide. If the tool fails, recover like
             a normal agent. Still must produce the milestone asset.
Tool       = Python at <repo>/flowsteps/tools/<id>/.
             Builder should develop it (fetch, MCP, crop, hash, …).
             Generate-new is a successful sketch.
```

## Do this

```powershell
python scripts/run_m8m.py --target <skill-or-flow-dir> --codebase <repo>
```

Or piecemeal:

```powershell
python scripts/audit_harness.py --target <skill-or-flow-dir>
python scripts/generate_harness.py --codebase <repo> --from-audit <skill>/planning/flowstep-audit.json
```

Deliverables (this is the product):

| File | What |
| --- | --- |
| `planning/flowstep-audit.md` | Proposed milestones, FlowSteps, tools |
| `planning/m8m-flowchart.md` | Milestone chart (harness) + FlowStep table (guide) + Gates/Loops on this.out |
| `<repo>/flowsteps/flows/<id>/flow.yaml` | Scaffolded chain |
| `<repo>/flowsteps/tools/<id>/` | Seeded tools, or stubs marked generate-new |
| `<repo>/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Pointer skill |

A stub tool or a generate-new row is a successful sketch, not a failed
build. The **milestone output schema is not a sketch**: it names the
asset that must exist. Runtime BLOCKs if that schema does not PASS.

Inside a milestone, follow the FlowStep table as a **guide**: try the
preferred tool first. If it fails, find a way like a normal agent.
The flowchart is only the milestone canvas.

## Milestone check (if / for)

if/else and foreach attach to **this.out** after the asset schema PASSes.
They are not FlowSteps, not tools, not intelligence.

- **if:** `next.when` / `else`. First gate schema that validates this.out
  picks the next milestone. No match → BLOCKED.
- **for:** this.out has a typed array (`maxItems` + item schema). That is
  the check. Assemble still runs once. Do not loop tools.

The chart's Gates and Loops tables name schema paths, not tools. An enum
on this.out is an if even when every branch then goes to the same next
milestone. An array with `maxItems` on this.out is a for even when the
milestone uses intelligence.

`validate_harness.py` is optional. `run_flow.py` is the harness:
tool fail → agent recovery; no asset → BLOCK; failed if/for check → BLOCK.

## Response

```text
Outcome: writer
Audit: planning/flowstep-audit.md
Chart: planning/m8m-flowchart.md
Flow: <repo>/flowsteps/flows/<flow_id>
Tools: <repo>/flowsteps/tools/
Notes: (name hints, generate-new tools — never a refusal to draw)
```

Return the flowchart markdown and the FlowStep table. Then the audit.
